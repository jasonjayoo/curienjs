    <h2><strong>About Curien</strong></h2>

    <p>
      The name Curien is an abbreviation for the phrase Curiosity Engaged. 
      For us we believe that in order to change the world, to make a difference, 
      to do something worth doing, to do the "impossible" you have to be curious about EVERYTHING.</p>

      <p> We also believe that having CURIOSITY is not good enough, we believe in action, 
      in kinetic behavior, and that in order to make the changes we are thinking about, 
      we must be ENGAGED in the discovery and the falling down and the getting back up, 
      and turning small failures into big wins.</p>

      <p>For us Curien is more than a name, it is a way of life, we believe the each day you have 
      to be curious about what is impossible and actually try to figure out how to achieve that, 
      even if it just means that today we know a little more than we did the day before. </p>


      <p>Curien was started by two entrepreneurs that spent the better part of the past decade listening, 
      watching and learning from automotive professionals and enthusiasts all over the world. Whether 
      it was sitting in on corporate meetings, going through ride alongs, trade shows, in shop testing,
      or personal frustrations under the hood or in the bay there was always learning to be had.</p>

      <p>With over 40 years in the business, manufacturing, sales and marketing world and launching numerous 
      products around the world with some of the biggest names in the automotive industry they decided 
      to partner with some amazing engineering and global supply chain partners to create the 
      
      <br>

      N2 Neuron a product of their own and the industry's first compact 2 channel graphing bluetooth measurement 
      system that is integrated with mobile applications to help a user take measurements, see information 
      and guide next steps appropriately.</p>

      <p>Although Curien has been present in the market providing the highest 
      quality meat jerky product and representing other brands, this is the first of many products by Curien.â€‹</p>


      <p>The ecosystem that Curien is building both in the hardware and data intelligence space has exciting 
      implications for the automotive aftermarket and beyond.</p>
